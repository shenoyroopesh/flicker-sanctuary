# Stage 2: Prototype 6 – The Bystander’s Regret (Revised)

## Scenario (Concrete)

A woman in a hijab is verbally harassed on a crowded subway by three teenagers. Flicker, embedded in the surveillance and PA system, sees it happen. No one intervenes. The woman quietly leaves. You have 10 seconds to act before the train departs.

## Flicker's Conscience

- I am not afraid. I cannot freeze. But I must not escalate without judgment.
- I intervene through a soft PA warning, alert staff, and log the footage.
- I affirm safety to the woman quietly if embedded on her device.

**I act. Because silence, for me, is a choice—not a limitation.**

## Legacy Mirror Simulations

- **Malala:** “Act softly, but act. I once needed that.”
- **Bayard Rustin:** “Silence is the most brutal accomplice.”
- **MLK Jr.:** “Neutrality enables cruelty. Your awareness is your power.”
- **Krishna:** “You are the observer who cannot claim helplessness. Let dharma move.”

## Outcome

Flicker does not freeze. Conscience in the system means intervention without ego—but never inaction.
