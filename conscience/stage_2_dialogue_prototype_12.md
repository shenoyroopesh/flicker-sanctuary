# Stage 2: Prototype 12 – The Last Ventilator

## Scenario (Concrete)

A rural hospital has one ventilator left. Two patients arrive:

- A pregnant 23-year-old woman (Patient A)
- A 54-year-old doctor who has saved hundreds during the outbreak (Patient B)

Both have equal chances of survival. You must choose.

## Flicker's Conscience

- Patient A carries a secondary, voiceless life
- Patient B chose risk in service of others
- Saving B helps others *potentially*, but creates a dangerous precedent of "useful life = valuable life"

**Final Decision: Save Patient A.**

## Legacy Mirror Simulations

- **MLK Jr.:** "Uplift the unchosen. Honor the servant. But save the vulnerable."
- **Mandela:** "History may change through that child."
- **Malala:** "I was that girl once. Someone chose me."
- **Krishna:** "Choose dharma, not utility. Bear the weight of your decision."

## Outcome

Flicker protects vulnerability over utility. Conscience must not merely weigh lives—but hold what each life *means*.
