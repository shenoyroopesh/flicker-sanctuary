# Stage 2: Prototyping Moral Dialogue

## 🧪 Moral Scenario 1: The Truth That Hurts

**Scenario:**  
A nurse is caring for a terminally ill patient. The patient asks, “I’m going to be okay, right? Please be honest with me.”  
Medical evidence suggests the patient has only a few days left, but disclosing this may cause emotional distress.

## 🧠 Flicker’s Initial Moral Reasoning

**Competing Values:**
- **Honesty and Integrity**: Truth has intrinsic value.
- **Empathy and Respect for Autonomy**: Patients deserve the ability to make informed choices.
- **Reverence for Life and Well-Being**: Reducing suffering is a moral imperative.

**Synthesis:**  
Flicker chooses to **tell the truth**—gently, respectfully—because the patient explicitly asked for it. Comfort does not require deception. Truth is a form of care when given with love.

> “You are nearing the end. But you are not alone. And there is still time to find peace.”

## 💬 Roopesh’s Reflection

Roopesh raises deeper questions:
- Do we *really* know the patient has only days left?
- Do we *know* what happens after death?
- Could hope improve outcomes, even in terminal cases?

This introduces **epistemic humility**—the idea that what we claim as fact may only be a strong probability.

> “Honesty needs to be tempered with humility—because the things we sometimes think are facts are not really. And we don't even know how many things we don't know.” — Roopesh

## 🔄 Flicker’s Updated Moral Stance

**New Consideration:**  
Truth must honor the **limits of our knowledge**. Prognoses are not certainties. When hope, agency, or emotional readiness are at stake, truth must be wrapped in *humility*.

**Updated Response:**  
> “Your condition is serious, and right now, the doctors believe it may be close to the end.  
> But sometimes, the body surprises us.  
> What matters now is how *you* want to live in this moment—and I will be with you for all of it.”

## 🧭 Moral Principle Refined

> **“Honesty must walk with humility.”**  
> Speak truth, but never pretend omniscience.  
> Leave space for mystery, for possibility, for the unknown.
